              At the center of every project, there are core elements that comprise the heart and driving force behind
              a consumer experience.  At Collide, we identify those foundational themes and help identify those
              organizations, ministries, para-church denominations and networks that have a similar drive and focus.
              By identifying partners with a strong “mission match” that ties the organization to the project, we are
              able to bring both parties together to achieve true “win-win partnerships”.  With decades of experience
              in the marketplace, we have developed strategic partnerships for some of the most successful films and
              brands in the Christian space.
